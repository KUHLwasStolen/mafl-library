# mafl-library
Useful tools for people interested in mathematics and computer science (with a focus on the latter)  

*Note:* As of now the output of `mafl -h` claims things that the project cannot YET do, as this is a very early stage.  

`mafl` stands for '*MA*ths' and '*A*utomata, *F*ormal *L*anguages and computation'.  
The project's aim is to implement everything I learned/learn at university about these two subjects.  
This does not mean that the project will be limited to this, but the basic idea is as stated above.  

*(This version of â€™README.md' is very very unfinished and will be updated soon)*
